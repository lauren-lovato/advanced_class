Project 2 
Option 1 - Understand the Fragile States Index  
The Fragile States Index is an open source dataset that ranks the fragility of the countries of the world. The FSI data is available as CSV files that ranks the courties in terms of fragility but also provides metrics on other aspects of each country's health, such as the econmony, human rights, and pliltical division. For this project, I want you to create a well documented Jupyter Notebook where you:  
  * Publish each FSI CSV file as a uniquly named feature service.
  * Create a webmap containing each feature service symbolized so that I can tell which countries are worse and which are better.
  * Describe the proocess and data along the way.
  * Please be as concise as possible with your code. Use for loops where possible rather than repreating code. If you do all of these things, you will get an A  

If you want an A+, please complete of of the following additoinal tasks. Either:  
  * Create a Storymap from your FSI Webmaps where your storymap has a new page for each year (this can be done manually, i.e. without Python).
  * Or, for each country, run the Mann-Kendall Test (mk_test.py) adn assess whether the FSI trend is improving, degrading, or unchanging over time.
